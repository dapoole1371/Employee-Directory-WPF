# Employee-Directory-WPF

I created this application in Visual Studio 2019
The application is a .Net WPF application written in C#

The main window allows navigation to a Directory of Employees, a Create New Employee Window, a Edit Employee Window, a Delete Employee Window, and a button to exit the application.

I incorporated Fluent Validation to provide input validation across the application.

The application persists data across sessions by using a SQLite database inside the application.
